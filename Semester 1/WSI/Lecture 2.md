### Database scaling
+ Vertical - changing/adding components to a single machine/server
+ Horizontal - having multiple machines/servers
	+ Horizontal scaling creates issues - what is our single source of truth? - Issue with the data's consistency. -> Relational databases

### Client-server architecture
Most databases operate using a **client-server architecture**, which means they have two main components: the server and the client.
+ The **server** is where the DBMS resides. It handles storing, managing, and processing of the data. The server is responsible for maintaining data integrity, handling queries, executing transactions, and ensuring data is available when required.
+ The **client** is any application, software, or tool that interacts with the database. It sends requests to the server, such as querying data, updating records, or inserting new data. These clients can be web apps, desktop software, or cli tools.

### Different dialects of SQL
SQL has various *dialects*, which are adaptations of the core SQL language by different RDBMS. While all SQL dialects follow the standard ANSI/ISO SQL syntax, many systems extend or modify the language to support unique features or optimizations.
#### MySQL
+ **Overview**: MySQL is one of the most popular open-source db systems, often used in web dev. ^11ec2b
+ **Unique features**:
	+ **AUTO_INCREMENT**: MySQL provides automatic numbering for primary keys using this feature
	+ **LIMIT**: Used to restrict the number of returned rows in a query
	+ **REPLACE INTO**: An extension that either inserts or replaces existing rows.
+ **Use case**: Widely used for websites and web apps.
#### PostgreSQL
+ **Overview**: Known for its advanced features and standards compliance, PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database. ^c98a94
+ **Unique features**:
	+ **JSON and JSONB**: Advanced support for storing and querying JSON data
	+ **WINDOW FUNCTIONS**: PostgreSQL includes sophisticated analytic functions like `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()`.
	+ **RETURNING Clause**: Allows returning data directly after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
+ **Use case**: Preferred for applications needing complex queries, data integrity, and high concurrency.

#### Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)
+ **Overview**: T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is the proprietary extension of SQL used by Microsoft SQL Servers. ^7bcd1e
+ **Unique features**:
	+ **TOP**: Like MySQL's `LIMIT`, used to specify how many rows to return
	+ **TRY-CATCH**: For handling errors within SQL code
	+ **MERGE**: Allows conditional `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations based on certain conditions
	+ **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**: Supports recursive queries using CTEs
+ **Use case**: Typically used in enterprise-level applications and with Microsoft's software ecosystem.

### Redundancies
Redundancies cause anomalies.
An example from the lecture: in a database full of data about books, there could be two authors who have the same names.
How to solve them?

**Normalization** - for example splitting the address to street name, no., zip code, city, etc. or the author's name to name, middle name, surname.
**The address might not have to be normalized in many cases** - apply normalization to frequently queried entries/columns

Make the data atomic
Non-key columns should only be dependent on the primary key (for example in the case of 2 books with the same title. Then we make the title as the primary key.)
Primary key - a value that identifies data
The primary key should be something that shouldn't have to be changed (for example after a mistake) - we should add a Book ID to our database. The client will never let us change it, because they don't know about its existence. The ID should be generated by the database
