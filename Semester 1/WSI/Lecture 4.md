### Task - Philharmony
The National Philharmony needs a database to achieve two interrelated objectives:
+ It should store info about performed musical pieces, their composers, and the instrumentation (how many and what types of instruments are needed for each piece), as well as the performers - specifying what each performer plays and which pieces they perform.
	+ We assume that each piece has one composer, but may require multiple instruments. A composer can create many pieces.
	+ Each performer specializes in playing one instruments, but can participate in performing many pieces.
	+ Multiple musicians may play the same instrument in the performance of a piece
+ It should allow recording which pieces are performed on a given day and which performer is playing a specific piece on that day
