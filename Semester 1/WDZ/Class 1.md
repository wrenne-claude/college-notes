## Managers
+ The term "manager" can be used in relation to all the various levels of management in the company. Most of the time, the term "manager" is used to describe someone who supervises others
+ Manager job titles:
	+ Team or area leader
	+ Front-line supervisor
	+ Mid-level manager
	+ Department head
	+ Vice-president
	+ Officer, chief officer

+ #### First-line managers - *day-to-day*
	+ They manage the work of non-managerial individuals or also known as operative employees, who are directly involved with the production or creation of the organization's products.
+ #### Middle managers
	+ They're all the managers between the first-line level and top level of the organization e.g. *department heads, marketing directors, finance chief officers.*
+ #### Top managers - *big picture stuff*
	+ They're responsible for making decisions about the direction of the organization and establishing the plans and goals that affect the entire organization.

## Managerial functions:
+ **Planning** - managers have to plan what they want to accomplish and develop specific actions in order to reach those goals
+ **Organizing** - managers must figure out how many people are needed to get the jobs and tasks done. Generally, we talk about what kind of structure will be put in place to get these tasks done
+ **Leading** - managers must supervise, motivate, train, coach, hire and assess employees.
+ **Controlling** - managers must monitor what's going on in their area to make sure that the goals or objectives are going to be met.
