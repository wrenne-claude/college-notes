### Management - science or art?
A little bit of both.\

**Peter F Drucker** on management:
1. It is concerned mainly with people
2. It's deeply rooted in cultures
3. It needs simple, clear objectives and values, shared by all employees (MBO)
4. It needs communication (Inside and outside of the organization)
5. It needs an extensive monitoring system
6. It must be customer-oriented
**Ricky W. Griffin:**
+ A set of activities (including **planning** and decision making, **organizing**, **leading** and **controlling**) directed at an organization's **resources** with the aim of achieving organizational **goals** in an efficient and effective manner.

### Management - definitions
**Management** - the achievement of **objectives** through **people** and other **resources**
**Management** - the process of setting and achieving goals through the execution of the **four basic functions** of management and utilizing human, financial and material resources.

### The four functions of management
1. Planning
2. Organizing
1. Directing/Leading
2. Controlling

Without a clear, **SMART** goal, we don't have much to plan

### SMART
1. Specific:
	+ The goal is concrete and tangible - everyone knows what it looks like
2. Measurable:
	+ The goal has an objective measure of success that everyone can understand
3. Attainable:
	+ The goal is challenging, but should be achievable with the resources available
4. Relevant:
	+ The goal meaningfully contributes to larger objectives like the overall mission
5. Timely:
	+ This goal has a deadline or, better yet, a timeline of progress milestones.

### In a game dev company:
+ **Game Conceptualization:**
	+ Managers explore and identify potential concepts, genres, and visions that could appeal to target audiences and fill market gaps.
+ **Resource Allocation:**
	+ Deciding on the allocation of various resources such as team assignments, technology, and budget to various aspects of game development.
+ **Risk Management:**
	+ Anticipating potential challenges related to technology, market dynamics, or team management, and formulating strategies to mitigate them.
+ **Team Structuring:**
	+ Forming teams based on the specific skill sets needed for the project, including design, development, writing and testing.
+ **Task Delegation:** 
	+ Assigning specific tasks and responsibilities to individuals or teams based on their specializations.
+ **Coordination:**
	+ Ensuring synchronicity between different departments, such as making sure that the development and story-writing teams are aligned in their efforts.

### Manager - 3 fundamental skills
+ Technical
	+ possess specific knowledge or have a specialized expertise
+ Human
	+ be able to work well with others both individually and in a group setting
+ Conceptual
	+ be able to see the "big picture" of the situation. Ability to arrive at ideas, create a vision and plan for the future

### Managers
1. **First-line managers** - manage the work of non-managerial individuals or also known as operative employees, who are directly involved with the production or creation of the organization's products.
2. **Middle-level managers** - all managers between the first-line level and top level of the organization, e.g. department head.
3. **Top-level managers** - responsible for making decisions about the direction of the organization and establishing the plans and goals that affect the entire organization
