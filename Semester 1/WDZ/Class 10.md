# Quality Management - part I
## Quality throughout history
+ Quality has been part of human life, culture and history from its earliest beginnings
+ Some philosophers, from Plato 2500 years ago in Greece, to Robert Pirsig in 1975, argue that quality can't be defined, that we just know it when we see it.

## The facets of quality
+ Universal level
	+ We are all awed by a night sky or a beautiful sunrise. All of us are relaxed by a swim in the sea and nourished by fresh water.
+ Cultural level
	+ Some cultural value systems create agreements about what is beautiful that last for centuries.
+ Social level
	+ Many styles and forms are agreed on by groups of people - economic or social classes, ethnic groups, families, or groups of friends - that are smaller than a whole culture but larger than the individual.
+ Personal level
	+ It is universally recognized that there is a valid personal element to taste, that there is no logical argument one can put forth to say what someone else should or should not like.
## Definitions
+ Despite the interest of managers, the academic literature on quality has not been reviewed extensively. The problem is one of coverage: scholars in fours disciplines - philosophy, economics, marketing and operations management - have considered the subject, but each group has viewed it from a different perspective
+ **Philosophy discipline** has focused on definitional issues
+ **Economics discipline** has focused on profit maximization and market equilibrium
+ **Marketing discipline** has focused on the determinants of buying behavior and customer satisfaction
+ **Operations management discipline** has focused on engineering practices and manufacturing control

## TQM
+ **Total Quality Management** was the first method to successfully implement the ideas of Taylor and Shewhart more than one company at a time
+ TQM is the father of all the quality management methods and standards that have come since, including Six Sigma, CMM, the Zero Defect
#### Definition of TQM
+ "A management philosophy embracing all activities through which the needs and expectations of the **customer** and **community**, and the objectives of the organization are satisfied in the most efficient and cost effective manner by maximizing the potential of **all** employees in a continuing drive for improvement."
#### Scope of TQM
TQM => Tools and Techniques => Management tools
### Cause-and-Effect diagram
+ AKA Ishikawa/fishbone diagram
+ The fishbone diagram was given its name due to its resemblance to a fish's skeleton
+ It identifies many possible causes for an effect of problem. It can be used to structure a brainstorming session.
#### Cause-and-Effect diagram procedure
1. Agree on a problem statement (effect). Write it at the center right of the flipchart/whiteboard/sheet. Draw a box around it and draw a horizontal arrow running to it.
2. Brainstorm the major categories of causes of the problem. If this is difficult, use generic headings (5m+e)
3. Write the categories of causes as branches
4. Brainstorm all the possible causes of the problem. As each idea is given, the facilitator writes it as a branch from the appropriate category.
5. Write sub-causes branching off the main causes. Continue asking "why"

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manpower    | The operational and/or functional labor of people engaged in delivery of a product and/or service                       | If "manpower" is identified as a cause resulting in an undesirable effect, it's more likely to be a factor of another of the 4m                                             |
| Machine     | Facilities, systems, tools and equipment employed for production                                                        | Machines, tools and facilities with their underlying support systems are frequently mismanaged to achieve excellence                                                        |
| Method      | Producing processes and their applicable/contributing service delivery processes                                        | Often processes are found to have too many steps, sign-offs and integral activities that don't create value for customers                                                   |
| Material    | Raw materials, components and consumables used to satisfy production and/or service delivery                            | Materials are often incorrectly specified, mislabeled, stored improperly to conserve physical properties, or otherwise could be organized and managed better.               |
| Measurement | Inspection and other physical measurements (distance, volume, temperature, pressure, etc.) whether manual or automatic. | Sometimes "measurement" can be inconsistent or incapable.                                                                                                                   |
| Environment | "Mother nature" (floods, earthquake, etc.); uncontrollable and/or unpredictable events                                  | Many predictable environmental factors can be considered and managed. There are rare, unavoidable causes of non-compliance beyond the influence of a production enterprise. |
