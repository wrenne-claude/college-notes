### Edgar Schein's model:
+ **Artifacts** - visible elements of the culture
+ **Values** - ethical statements of rightness
+ **Assumptions** - unconscious and taken for granted ways of seeing the world

**Google:**
+ Artifacts:
	+ Googleplex, work environment, free food
	+ Focusing on the end-user experience (no distractions on their pages, sponsored links that are clearly marked as such)
	+ Employee scouting through "brain teaser" billboards / other clever methods
+ Values:
	+ Mission statement ("To organize the world's information and to make it universally accessible and useful")
	+ Motivating workers with a friendly work environment
	+ Encouraging risk taking and innovation
+ Assumptions:
	+ "Don't be evil" mantra
	+ Decentralized "power", no senior person in charge
	+ Employees are treated (mostly) equally (e.g. Kai-Fu Lee sharing a cubicle with 2 other employees)
