^d577a6

+ **Organizational structure** - the formal arrangement of task, communication and authority relationships that influence and control how people co-ordinate and conduct their work ^09962e
+ **Organigram** or an organization chart - a diagram which consists of **boxes** (representing groupings, positions or other structural units) and **lines** (depicting reporting relationships)

+ **Span of control** - the number of subordinates that a manager or supervisor can directly control ^37855c
+ **Unity of command** - only one supervisor to respond to
 ^7945a3
+ **Flat**  (for example a 3-level hierarchy) / **Tall** (e.g. 7-level) organizational structure types

#### Differences between flat and tall structures

|           Structure           |                                      FLAT                                       |                                      TALL                                       |
|:-----------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|      **Span of control**      |     **Wide** span of control (each manager has to manage many subordinates)     | **Narrow** span of control (each manager has to manage only a few subordinates) |
|  **Control of subordinates**  |                                  Loose control                                  |                                  Close control                                  |
|           **Cost**            |                           Less costly (less managers)                           |                             Costly (many managers)                              |
|       **Communication**       | Communication will not be distorted and/or delayed because there are few layers |   Communication may be distorted and/or delayed because there are many layers   |
|      **Decision making**      |                               Quick (few layers)                                |                              Slower (more layers)                               |

## Ex. 1
+ Darren = manager of a branch of a well known tool hire firm
+ Anna = assistant manager, reports to Darren
+ Anna delegates to the department managers (Jane, Tom, Omar)
+ Felicity, Matt, Ryan report to Jane
+ Rachel, Sally, Pete are accountable to Tom
+ Omar is responsible for John, Mark, Sam and James
---
+ Draw chart
+ Who has the largest span of control?
+ How many layers?
+ Who does Tom delegate to?
+ Tall or flat structure?
+ Why? ^^^

## Functional structure
+ **Advantages**
	+ Critical mass of a functional activity that supports efficiency within a function
	+ Skill development
+ **Disadvantages**
	+ Relatively slow speed of response to environmental change
	+ Lower innovation and change readiness
	+ Frequent decision overload at the top of the function
	+ Inter-functional communication and co-ordination problems due to different and even conflicting objectives and orientations (**silo effect**)
## Divisional structure
+ Results in multiple sub-units that are focused on different products, regions and markets or market segments.
The divisional structure is particularly appropriate where there are a number of very different product or service offerings, significantly different market conditions for different offerings, or large geographic dispersion
+ **Advantages**
	+ Fast response to changing environmental conditions
	+ Customer satisfaction is typically higher
+ **Disadvantages**
	+ Duplication of functions across division
	+ Poorer co-ordination across divisional boundaries
	+ Lower technical specialization and specialist competence in divisional functions
	+ Limitations to integration and standardization across divisions
## Process oriented structure
+ Seeks to align the structure of the organization with the workflows and core processes that aim at addressing and meeting customer needs
+ **Advantages**
	+ Flexible and responsive reactions to customer demands
	+ Minimize the disconnects in flows of information, material or people
	+ Provides potentially satisfying work environment
	+ Customer satisfaction is typically higher
+ **Disadvantages**
	+ The level of failed applications is high (too complex to apply easily, the costs can outweigh the benefits)
+ **Hybrid structures** - these apply to more than one of the departmentation principles simultaneously. The best known of which is the **matrix** structure

## Mechanistic and organic organizational forms

^47b3d6

+ **Mechanistic organizations** - these provide a blueprint of an organizational structure that is often compared to a machine: all the parts are clearly aligned to work together in prescribed, predetermined and stable ways. ^3318c0
+ **Organic organizations** - sometimes referred to as organismic organizations. Reflects an organizational form emerging in fluid and relatively unpredictable situations. It is typified by a high level of flexibility in job responsibilities, also incorporating high levels of technical expertise at the lower level of the organization and recognition of the value of individual contribution.
#### Differences:

| Organizational form                   | MECHANISTIC                      | ORGANIC                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Nature of tasks**                   | Routine                          | Nonroutine                     |
| **Degree of standardization**         | High                             | Low                            |
| **Degree of formalization**           | High                             | Low                            |
| **Differentation and specialization** | Low to medium                    | Medium to high                 |
| **Hierarchy of authority**            | Tall with narrow span of control | Flat with wide span of control |
| **Decision making**                   | Centralized                      | Decentralized                  |
