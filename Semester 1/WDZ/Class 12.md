# Process management
A process is a stream of activities that transforms **input** elements (tangible and intangible) into **output** elements
+ **Procedure** - a specific way of carrying out a process
+ **Monitoring:**
	+ **Efficiency**: the relationship between the results achieved and the inputs used
	+ **Effectiveness**: ability to achieve the desired objectives
+ **Process:** sequence of interrelated or interacting activities

### Process management stages:
+ Defining the strategy
+ Identification, selection and description of processes
+ Process modelling
+ Implementation and execution of processes
+ Controlling the implementation of processes
+ Process improvement

##### Strategy
*Determining the company's major long-term objectives and adopt such courses of action and such allocation of resources as are necessary to achieve the objectives.* - Chandler 1962
*A set of goals and major organizational undertakings* - Tilles

### Competition strategy
+ The essence of the key problem of competitive strategy: show customers why it is better to buy goods from you than from your competitors. "If you don't provide them with the right argument, only a very good price can save you." (J. Trout)
+ Why do/will customers buy from us and not our competitors?
	+ Usability criteria (end result for the customer)
	+ Service-related criteria (throughout the contact process)
	+ Value signals
### Process identification
+ Process identification is the first step in the implementation of the process management concept.
+ Process identification can be done using two approaches:
	+ top-down (from the general to the specific)
	+ bottom-up (from the specific to the general)
### Process selection
+ At the first stage of process selection should also occur process management
+ The identified set of processes is various in terms of the nature of their components and their role in the value chain. In this respect, processes in the organization can be divided into:
	+ primary processes
	+ support (auxiliary) processes
	+ management processes
### Description of processes
Each identified process can be described by several characteristics

| Characteristics | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Name            |             |
| Goal            |             |
| Inputs          |             |
| Outputs         |             |
| Suppliers       |             |
| Customer(s)     |             |
| Owner           |             |
| Meters          |             |
### Process modelling
+ A way of defining the architecture of particular processes necessary for the enterprise to achieve its goals
+ Depending on working technique, two ways of process modelling can be distinguished: **manual** and **by machine.**
+ **Choice of modelling notation:**
	+ BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
	+ UML (Unified Modelling Language)
	+ EPC (Event-Driven Process Chains)
	+ "own" notation
