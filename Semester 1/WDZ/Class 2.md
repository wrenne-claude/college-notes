The history of management can be traced back to 5000 B.C. when the agriculture revolution was at the initial stage
In Egypt, in 2900 B.C., the pyramids were built in a highly organised and coordinated manner

## Schools of management thought

^ca340a

+ Classical school of Management
	+ Scientific Management
	+ Administrative Management
+ Human-Relation School of Management
+ Mathematical or Quantitative School of Management
+ Systems School of Management
+ Contingency School of Management
#### Scientific Management:
+ Use scientific methods to study work and determine the most efficient way to perform specific tasks
+ Match workers to their jobs based on capability and motivation, and train them to work at maximum efficiency
+ Monitor worker performance, and provide instructions and supervision to ensure that they're using the most efficient ways of working
+ Allocate the work

 Frederick Winslow Taylor
+ The optimal weight that a worker should lift in a shovel is 21 pounds.
+ The shovel should be sized so that it would hold 21 pounds of the substance being shoveled
+ The firm provided the workers with optimal shovels
**Result**: Three to four fold increase in productivity
#### Henry Ford

#### Lilian and Frank Gilbreth
+ Frank and Lilian Gilbreth invented and refined therbligs, roughly between 1908 and 1924
+ Therbligs comprise a system for analyzing the motions involved in performing a task
+ The identification of individual motions, as well as moments of delay in the process, was designed to find unnecessary or inefficient motions and to utilize or eliminate even split-seconds of waster time

### Administrative management
Henri Fayol
Max Weber

+ A very formalized structure with clear lines of authority from the top down (**hierarchical structure**).
At the top is the board of directors who give directions to the CEO, who in turn gives directions the vice presidents of each corporate division. The vice presidents will then give directions to their middle managers, who in turn give directions to supervisors down to individual employees.

+ Division of labor - each department is responsible for a particular aspect of the organization's activities towards the achievement of organizational goals

Large corporations may have a production division, marketing division, etc. Each works on a particular aspect of the company's business.

+ Delegation of power and authority
If you don't have the power and authority to engage in tasks necessary for achieving specific objectives you are charged with achieving, the organization can't meet its overall goal.

### Human-relation school of Management
Elton Mayo, Abraham Maslow, Douglas McGregor

Based on increasing efficiency by providing a better environment for the laborers.

Theory X - pessimistic, workers need to be pushed
Theory Y - optimistic, decentralized and participative management - encourages a collaborative and trust-based relationship between workers and managers ^857b46

### Quantitative School
Systems perspective:
+ **Entropy** is the tendency of systems to deteriorate or break down over time ^30bc9c
+ **Synergy** is the ability of the whole system to equal more than the sum of its parts ^7bde5c

### Contingency School
+ Can be summarized as **"it all depends"**
+ The appropriate management actions and approaches depend on the situation
+ Managers with a contingency view use a flexible approach

What were the changes in production and management introduced in Ford Motor Company?

At the beginning, in order to make easily accessible commercial cars, Ford divided each part of the production process into the smallest possible tasks, making workers repeat the same tiny action over and over.
After pushing his workers to their limit in order to optimize the production as much as possible, *the turnover was 380 percent*.
Ford then doubled everybody's wages (which resulted in crowds of people willing to work for him), and that solved the problem - his workers were more eager and willing to work.
