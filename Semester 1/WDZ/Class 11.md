## Kaizen
+ Over 30 years ago, Masaaki Imai sat down to pen the groundbreaking book "Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success"
+ Through this book the term KAIZEN was introduced in the western world. Today KAIZEN is recognized worldwide as an important pillar of an organization's long-term competitive strategy.
+ Kaizen means improvement. Moreover, it means continuing improvement in personal, home, social and working life. 
Kai = change, Zen = for the better

#### Kaizen and Innovation - key differences
Imai's thesis is that Japanese business culture focuses on Kaizen. He contrasts this with Western business culture, which focuses on **innovation.**

## Kaizen's 5S framework
Teamwork, Self-Discipline, Improved Morale, Quality Circles, Improvement Suggestions
**Elimination of Waste, Standardization**

#### Muda, Mura & Muri
+ **Muda** - any activity that adds no real value to the product or service being created or delivered
	+ **Overproduction** - producing more than your customer is requesting or before they request it;
	+ **Time on Hand (waiting)** - waiting done by customers or by employees;
	+ **Transportation** - unnecessary conveyance of products, from one location to another, or handoff from one employee to another;
	+ **Processing** - unnecessary manual work that does not contribute value to the product;
	+ **Stock on Hand (inventory)** - more materials or information than is required;
	+ **Movement** - unnecessary physical or mental motion often associated with searching;
	+ **Defective Products** - a mistake which reaches the customer;
+ **Mura** - 
+ **Muri** - 

## Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
A computer-based inventory
+ During the early parts of the 20th century, material and planning control systems started using mathematics to calculate manufacturing lot sizes. In 1913, F.W Harris introduced the Economic Order Quantity model, and it is still studied today for inventory management.
+ J. Orlicky developed MRP in 1964, while working for IBM to perform computerized supply planning. Orlicky was on a mission to educate senior executive customers to use computer technology to manage their inventory and control processes. At IBM, Orlicky worked with O. Wight, who ended up co-authoring a book with G. Plossl in 1967, *Production and Inventory Control: Principles and Techniques*
#### Types of data considered by MRP
+ Name of the final product that's being created. This is sometimes called independent demand or Level "0" on BOM
+ What and when info. How much quantity is required to meet demand? When is it needed?
+ The shelf life of stored materials.
+ Inventory status records. Records of net materials available for use that are already in stock and materials on order from suppliers.
+ **Bills of materials.** Details of the materials, components, and sub-assemblies required to make each product.
+ **Planning data.** This includes all the restraints and directions to produce such items as routing, labor and machine standards, quality and testing standards, lot sizing techniques, and other inputs.
#### What is a Bill of Materials? (BOM)
+ A bill of materials (BOM) is an extensive list of raw materials, components, and instructions required to construct, manufacture, or repair a product or service. A bill of materials usually appears in a hierarchical format, with the highest level displaying the finished product and the bottom level showing individual components and materials.
+ **Product structure tree -** visual depiction of the requirements in a bill of materials, where all components are listed by levels.
