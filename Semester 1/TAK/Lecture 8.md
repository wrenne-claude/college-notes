## Motherboards
A motherboard is a laminated board with properly routed paths, surface or internally soldered electronic components, integrated circuits and sockets.

The most important elements of the motherboard are:
+ Chipset
+ Microprocessor socket
+ Voltage regulator
+ RAM slots
+ I/O bus connectors
+ BIOS ROM
+ I/O ports
+ storage interface channels
+ configuration and signal pins
#### Chipset
One or a group of specialized integrated circuits or expansion cards designed to work together. The performance and reliability of the computer depend on this chip because it organizes the flow of information between the individual components of the central unit.

**The chipset consists of a North Bridge and a South Bridge:**
+ The **North Bridge (MCH - Memory Controller Hub)** is responsible for exchanging data between the operating memory and the processor and controls the graphics card bus
+ The **South Bridge (ICH - I/O Controller Hub)** is responsible for cooperation with I/O devices
