### Digital information in computers
Computers can store and process information using binary variables, i.e. variables that can take only two different values conventionally marked 0 and 1.

The symbols 0 and 1 usually correspond to different voltage levels, where 0 is the low state, and 1 is the high voltage state.

Low and high levels - certain ranges

#### Units of information
1 bit - bit - b
8 bits - byte - B
16 bits - 16 bits word - 16b
32 bits

LSB - least significant bit
MSB - most significant bit
