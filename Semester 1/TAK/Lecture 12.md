# Humans as the end user of computer systems
1. Why is understanding humans as users important?
2. How have interactions between humans and computers evolved over the years?
3. How do humans "communicate" with computers today, and what tools do they use?
4. Applications, their types, and what are the mechanisms that make some success while others fail?
5. What is UI/UX, what are the differences between them, and why is it worth knowing their basics?

### Who or what is the end user?
The end user can be a person, but also:
+ An organization
+ A company
+ Or even another system.
### Why is understanding human-computer interaction important?
+ Initially used as calculating machines, then used to optimize processes such as population censuses, computers from the beginning of their existence were intended to meet the complex needs of people, mainly related to mathematical calculations and data processing.
+ Information technology (IT) arose from the need to process, store and transit information efficiently and reliably.

1. **Improving usability:** A good understanding of HCI allows for the design of systems and applications that are intuitive and easy to use. This helps users to effectively utilize technology without frustration.
2. **Increasing productivity:** Systems designed with the end user in mind can significantly boost productivity, as users can perform their tasks more quickly and efficiently.
3. **Enhancing accessibility:** HCI helps create technologies that are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. This ensures that more people can use technology without barriers.
4. **Improving user satisfaction:** Users who have positive experiences with technology are more satisfied and loyal to the products and services.
5. **Ensuring safety:** Good HCI practices can also enhance the safety of systems by minimizing user errors that could lead to security issues.
### What has computer-human interaction looked like over the years?
#### Mechanical calculating machines based on gears and toothed wheels
Inventors of such machines:
+ Blaise Pascal, who created a machine capable of adding,
+ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, whose mechanical computer could handle various arithmetical operations the user chose.
In the machines of these inventors, values from the user were entered by rotating the gears to the desired values. The values after calculations were read similarly to a car odometer.
#### The difference engine of Charles Babbage
+ This advanced calculator was intended to produce logarithm tables used in navigation. The value of numbers was represented by the positions of the toothed wheels marked with decimal numbers.
+ The machine used punch cards as an input
+ The output was printed on a sheet of paper
#### Punch cards as an input
Many early computers used punch cards as an input medium for both computer programs and data, here are a few examples:
1. **ENIAC:** One of the first general-purpose electronic computers, which used punched cards for data input.
2. **IBM NORC:** A computer built by IBM for the United States Navy, which also used punched cards
3. **IBM 1401:** A popular computer from the 1960s that used punched cards for inputting data and programs.
4. **UNIVAC I:** The first commercial computer, which also used punched cards.
Punched cards were commonly used until the mid-1970s, before being replaced by more modern data storage technologies.
#### What did the output of computers using punched cards as input look like?
Early computers that used punched cards had various methods of outputting data. Here are a few examples:
+ **Line printers:** Printouts on paper were one of the main ways to present results. Line printers, such as the IBM 1403, could print large amounts of data on continuous paper.
+ **Accounting machines:** Machines like the IBM 407 were used to create accounting reports and other documents, printing results on special forms.
+ **Magnetic tapes:** Data could also be recorded on magnetic tapes, which were used to store large amounts of information for later processing.
+ **Punched cards:** Results could also be recorded on new punched cards, which other machines could then read.
### The evolution of user input collection in the 20th century:
1. **Punched cards:** One of the earliest and most commonly used data storage media. They were used for inputting both programs and data.
2. **Punched tape:** Similar to punched cards but in tape form, which could store more data and was easier to process automatically.
3. **Keyboards:** Became common in the 1960s and 1970s, allowing users to input data directly.
4. **Computer mice:** Introduced in the 1980s, they allowed interaction with GUIs

1. **Scanners:** Enabled the digitization of documents and images, which was particularly useful in offices.
2. **Joysticks and gamepads:** Mainly used in computer games, they allowed for more intuitive control over games
3. **Microphones:** Allowed for the input of sound into computers, which was used in speech recognition and communication applications
4. **Cameras**
### What input devices are used nowadays?
#### What is HID?
HID (Human Interface Device) is a standard that enables communication between input devices such as keyboards, mice, joysticks and a computer. The main principles of HID are:
+ **Ease of installation:** HID devices are usually plug-and-play, meaning they do not require additional drivers to operate.
+ **Compatibility:** The HID standard is supported by most operating systems, ensuring broad compatibility
+ **Flexibility:** HID supports various types of input devices, allowing for easy addition of new devices without the need to modify the system.
HID devices contain programmed data, called HID descriptors, which inform the computer about the type and functions of the device.
#### Computer mice
1. **Optical mice:** These use an LED light to detect movement. They are highly accurate and work well on most surfaces, except for glass. Optical mice are commonly used for everyday task and office work.
2. **Laser mice:** These use a laser to detect movement, offering even greater precision than optical mice. They are ideal for tasks that require high accuracy, such as graphic design and gaming. However, they often require a mouse pad for optimal performance.
3. **Trackball mice:** These mice have a stationary base with a ball that the user manipulates with their thumb or fingers to move the cursor. They are useful for users with limited desk space and can reduce strain on the wrist.
#### Keyboards
1. **Mechanical keyboards:** Mechanical keyboards use individual mechanical switches under each key. Each switch consists of metal components that make contact when the key is pressed. Mechanical keyboards can be louder, especially models with "clicky" switches.
2. **Membrane keyboards:** Membrane keyboards use a flexible rubber or silicone membrane that makes contact with an electrical circuit when a key is pressed. Membrane keyboards are generally quieter than mechanical ones, which can be an advantage in office environments.
3. **Hybrid keyboards:** Hybrid keyboards combine features of mechanical and membrane keyboards, offering a compromise between durability and quiet operation. They may use spring-loaded keys and capacitive electrostatic sensors, allowing for more precise and faster key presses.
#### Touchscreens
Touchscreens are displays that respond to the touch of a finger or stylus. They are commonly used in laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other devices.
+ **Resistive screens** operate based on pressure, where two conductive layers touch each other when pressed, causing a change in electrical resistance (used mostly in the past)
+ **Capacitive screens** use changes in the electrostatic field to detect touch, allowing for precise touch detection and multi-touch functionality.

### What are output devices?
An output device is computer hardware that converts data processed by the computer into a form understandable to the user or another system. These devices are responsible for conveying information from the computer to the outside world. Some of their examples are:
+ Monitor
+ Printer
+ Speakers/Headphones
+ Projector
#### Monitors:
Currently, monitors available on the market can be divided into three main types:
+ **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):** The most popular type, characterized by good image quality and energy efficiency.
+ **LED (Light Emitting Diode):** LCD version with LED backlight, offering better contract and brightness.
+ **OLED (Organic LED):** Each pixel emits light independently, which provides excellent image quality and deep blacks.
It is worth noting that the above monitors have many subtypes (depending on the matrix type) - IPS, VA, TN for liquid crystal, or AMOLED for OLED. The type of monitor used depends on the application and price.
