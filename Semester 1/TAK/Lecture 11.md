Magnetic memories can be divided into two types:
+ floppy disks
+ hard disks
Disks are made of non-magnetic materials, e.g.:
+ foil - floppy
+ copper, aluminum, and many others - hard
The surfaces of the disks on which the recording is made are covered with a magnetic layer, e.g. iron oxide, cobalt, etc.
The thickness of the magnetic layer:
+ floppy - several micrometers
+ hard drive - fractions of a micrometer

#### Construction of traditional hard drives
Disc platters

Disk dimensions:
+ large computers 14", 10" 8."
+ PC 5,25", 3,5."
+ notebooks, laptops, etc. 2,5", 1,8."
The plates are made of 1/8" thick aluminum alloy (lightweight and showing minimal changes under the influence of temperature).
The thickness of the magnetic layer - fractions of a micrometer.
The Hard Disk Assembly (HDAv) encloses plates, heads and their mechanisms.
