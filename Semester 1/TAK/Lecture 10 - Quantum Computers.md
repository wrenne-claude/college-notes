## Introduction
**"Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it"** - *Niels Bohr*
**"It is safe to say that nobody understands quantum mechanics"** - *Richard Feynman*

**"If [quantum theory] is correct, it signifies the end of physics as a science** - *Albert Einstein*
**"I do not like [quantum mechanics], and I am sorry I ever had anything to do with it"** - *Erwin Schrodinger*

## How did it start?
1859 - Gustav Kirchoff - law of radiation
1900 - Max Planck - solving the problem of infinite energy - **the postulate of the existence of discrete energy packages (quants)**
*Planck's constant -* $E = hv = 6,62607015 * 10^(-34)J * s$ 
1905 - Albert Einstein - the postulate that light is a set of quants

#### Interference
Classical vs Quantum physics

## Introduction to quantum computers
Interference in quantum physics and the observed phenomenon leads to a phenomenon called the **superposition phenomenon**

"All of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment [double slit Young experiment]" - *Richard Feynman*
**Quantum objects can be in many states simultaneously!**

"In classical mechanics, there's no real difference between states and measurements - In quantum mechanics, the difference is profound" - Leonard Susskind (*Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum*)

**Measurement/observer effect -** observation "changes" reality
**Quantum entanglement -** quantum objects can interact with each other over a distance

## What is a qubit?
**Bit** - 0 1
**Qubit** - Quantum bit, **superposition of states between 0 and 1**
Good visualization of a qubit - a Bloch sphere
