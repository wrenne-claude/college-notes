### Boolean algebra laws
#### Distributive law
(A+B) * C = A * C + B * C
(A * B) + C = (A + C) * (B + C)

#### Absorption law
A + (A * B) = A
A * (A + B) = A

#### Inversion law
A (with two lines above it) = A

### Resistors (R)
**Resistors** are used to limit the current flowing in an electrical circuit. There is a voltage drop on it. With the flow of current, it converts electrical energy into heat.
The unit of resistance is $\Omega$.

*Potentiometer - (adjustable resistor) - a resistor with the possibility of changing the resistance by the user*

### Varistor (V)
**Varistor** -a semiconductor electronic element (a type of resistor) with nonlinear resistance characteristics, depending on the applied voltage.

For small voltages, it is characterised by high resistance (hundreds of kiloohms). After exceeding the voltage level specified for a given varistor, its resistance drops sharply (several ohms).

Used in receiver protection systems against damage caused by voltage that's too high.

### Photoresistor (F)
**Photoresistor** - an electronic photosensitive element whose resistance changes under the influence of lighting, regardless of the direction of the applied voltage. The beam of light falling on the photoresistor causes an increase in the flowing current (a decrease in its resistance). The value of this current depends on the intensity of lighting.

### Capacitor (C)
The **capacitor** can accumulate electric charge. It's made of two conductors (so-called covers), between which there is a dielectric layer. The unit of capacity is the **farad (F)**.
The capacitor is one of the most widely used electronic components.
Types:
+ Electrolytic
+ Tantalum
+ Foil
+ Ceramic
+ Air
+ Tuning (variable)

### Diode (D)
The operation of most **diodes** is to conduct current in one direction (called the direction of conduction) and block its flow in the other (rectified diodes).
Types:
+ Rectifying
+ stabilization
+ Tunnel
+ Schottky
+ capacitive (varicaps)

#### Rectifying
diode used to rectify AC current
#### LED
emitting the visible light and infrared range
#### Photodiode
reacting to light
#### Zener
a diode whose characteristic feature is the ability to conduct current in the opposite direction of traditional conductivity after reaching a specific voltage (breakdown voltage)
#### Tunnel
a diode characterized by a negative value of dynamic resistance after exceeding a particular value of forwarding voltage
#### Capacitive
a diode in which the phenomenon of capacitance change is used under the influence of a change in voltage applied in the prohibitive direction
#### Schottky
a diode that has a small capacitance of the connector, thanks to which the typical switching time is only about 100 ps. Schottky diodes with small dimensions can operate at a frequency of up to several dozen GHz

### Transistor (T)
a three-electrode semiconductor electronic component, having the ability to amplify an electrical signal.
In digital technology, it acts as a switch (electronic key).
+ Bipolar transistors
	+ pnp, npm
+ Unipolar transistors
	+ JFET, MOSFET

### Inductor
**Inductor (coil)** - an electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil.
Inductors resist changes in current intensity.

### Transformer (Tr)
an electrical device for the transfer of AC electrical energy by induction from one electrical circuit to another.
+ Coreless transformer
+ Transformer with core
### Crystal oscillator (X)
an electronic element, the principle of operation of which is based on the piezoelectric phenomenon in the quartz crystal. It is designed to stabilize the vibration frequency of electronic oscillators.
