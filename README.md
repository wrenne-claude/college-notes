# college-notes
# This is a repository for Obsidian backups
I'll be using this repo as a sort of sync server for my notes, because I want to have access to whatever I've written on my college laptop from my main machine that I do most of my work on at home.

Feel free to browse through these notes. I'll try to keep this as clean as possible but you'll never know.

## A bit about my studies:
+ I study at PJAIT (*Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology*).
+ I'm studying computer science.
+ I'm awful at math and hope to get better during my stay here.
+ Despite being born and raised here in Poland, I decided to study in English in order to become better at the language.
